## What is a web server? Hardware and software side
A web server refers to both hardware and software components that work together to deliver content (web pages, images, files, etc.) to users over the Internet or an intranet. 

## What are some different web server applications?

### Apache HTTP Server
Itâ€™s almost synonymous to the World Wide Web, and still powers the majority of websites in the world.

### Nginx
While Apache is arguably at par today, Nginx offered some stunning improvements that helped it win.

### Lighttpd
Lighthttpd is a capable, single-threaded web server that can easily handle a few hundred requests per second and still go easy on system resources.

OpenLiteSpeed makes a lot of sense for WordPress-based content-driven websites, as page optimizations are already part of the server.

### Caddy
Think of Caddy as an Nginx-like web server (similar syntax and all) but everything is simplified to a pleasant extreme.

### Cherokee
It does provide an easy, fun and performant alternative to the mainstream web servers.
